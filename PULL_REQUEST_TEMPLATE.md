### Description
- Added the Sellout Quest which grants Advertisement cards to the player. They can be removed manually, but one also get removed every 5 combats won. Removing all of them clears the quest and grants Gold equal to 10 times the number of Advertisements played.
- In order to track parameters without having it be a requirement, I also added the OptionalTriggerTracker and OptionalTriggeredUpdateTracker, though the code is very scuffed.
